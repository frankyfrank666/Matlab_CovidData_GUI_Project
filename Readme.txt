Datacell:
Cov_data.mat

APP Designer File:
CovidMeter.mlapp & CovidMeterInterrupt&Queue.mlapp

Plotting functions:
RefreshPlot.m

Packaged Installers:
CovidMeter.mlappinstall & CovidMeter_Interrupt&Queue.mlappinstall


The only difference between them is that Interrupt&Queue variant has Interrupt&Queue  running mod which might be faster but more prone to lags when PC setup is old. Feel free to try both. 


I recommend you to run from online matlab via this link if you have a matlab account.
